# Clicky Game

Georgia Tech Boot Camp - Clicky Game - Assignment #15 React Github

**Game Instructions** Try to click on every cartoon picture once. When you click a toons picture the grid will automatically shuffle. The goal of the game is click all 15 animaniacs pictures once despite the shuffled grid. If you click any picture twice the game will reset and you must begin again!

The Clicky-Game primarily introduces REACT and all its benefits. Though this game is not persistent it is easy to understand the reusable component concept using REACT truly improves the development process.
